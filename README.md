# Dog Crush

This game was inspired by games like Candy Crush and Bejeweled, that I used play to when I was youger.
To develop it, I put into practice my knowledge acquired after two weeks in Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp.

## About the game

The main goal is to make the highest score in only 1 minute. 

To score, you need to crush 3 or more dogs horizontally or vertically.

With each formation, the player accumulates 100 points per dog lined up and the formation disappears from the board, giving space to new random dogs on the board.
